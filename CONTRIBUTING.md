### 🧱 Project Architecture
AutoDoc.ai is a full-stack application utilizing the MERN stack alongside Python and Gemini AI.

* **Frontend (`/src`):** Built with React and Vite. Contains all user-facing components, routing via React Router, and CSS/glassmorphism styling.
* **Backend / API:** Powered by Node.js and Express. Handles API routes, communicates with MongoDB, and integrates Python scripts to communicate securely with the Gemini AI API for documentation generation.

### 🖥️ Local Development Rules
Because AutoDoc.ai relies on backend processes to analyze repositories and ping the Gemini API, **certain features require both the frontend and backend servers to be running.**
